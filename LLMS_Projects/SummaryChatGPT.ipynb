There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.\n",

It is a\\nfield of research\\nin\\ncomputer science\\nthat develops and studies methods and\\nsoftware\\nthat enable machines to\\nperceive their environment\\nand use\\nlearning\\nand\\nintelligence\\nto take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nHigh-profile\\napplications of AI\\ninclude advanced\\nweb search engines\\n(e.g.,\\nGoogle Search\\n);\\nrecommendation systems\\n(used by\\nYouTube\\n,\\nAmazon\\n, and\\nNetflix\\n);\\nvirtual assistants\\n(e.g.,\\nGoogle Assistant\\n,\\nSiri\\n, and\\nAlexa\\n);\\nautonomous vehicles\\n(e.g.,\\nWaymo\\n);\\ngenerative\\nand\\ncreative\\ntools (e.g.,\\nChatGPT\\nand\\nAI art\\n); and\\nsuperhuman\\nplay and analysis in\\nstrategy games\\n(e.g.,\\nchess\\nand\\nGo\\n). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s\\nnot labeled AI anymore\\n.\"\\n[\\n2\\n]\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning,\\nreasoning\\n,\\nknowledge representation\\n,\\nplanning\\n,\\nnatural language processing\\n,\\nperception\\n, and support for\\nrobotics\\n.\\n[\\na\\n]\\nTo reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including\\nsearch\\nand\\nmathematical optimization\\n,\\nformal logic\\n,\\nartificial neural networks\\n, and methods based on\\nstatistics\\n,\\noperations research\\n, and\\neconomics\\n.\\n[\\nb\\n]\\nAI also draws upon\\npsychology\\n,\\nlinguistics\\n,\\nphilosophy\\n,\\nneuroscience\\n, and other fields.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nSome companies, such as\\nOpenAI\\n,\\nGoogle DeepMind\\nand\\nMeta\\n, aim to create\\nartificial general intelligence\\n(AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nand the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout\\nits history\\n,\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nfollowed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as\\nAI winters\\n.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nFunding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when\\ngraphics processing units\\nstarted being used to accelerate neural networks, and\\ndeep learning\\noutperformed previous AI techniques.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nThis growth accelerated further after 2017 with the\\ntransformer architecture\\n.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nIn the 2020s, the period of rapid\\nprogress\\nmarked by advanced generative AI became known as the\\nAI boom\\n. Generative AI and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised\\nethical concerns\\nabout\\nAI\\'s long-term effects\\nand potential\\nexistential risks\\n, prompting discussions about\\nregulatory policies\\nto ensure the\\nsafety\\nand benefits of the technology.\\nGoals\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n[\\na\\n]\\nReasoning and problem-solving\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical\\ndeductions\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nBy the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with\\nuncertain\\nor incomplete information, employing concepts from\\nprobability\\nand\\neconomics\\n.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nEven humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAccurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\nKnowledge representation\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\nKnowledge representation\\nand\\nknowledge engineering\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nallow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nscene interpretation,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nclinical decision support,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nknowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large\\ndatabases\\n),\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nand other areas.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nA\\nknowledge base\\nis a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An\\nontology\\nis the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nKnowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nsituations, events, states, and time;\\n[\\n25\\n]\\ncauses and effects;\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nknowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);\\n[\\n27\\n]\\ndefault reasoning\\n(things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nand many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of\\ncommonsense knowledge\\n(the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nand the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nThere is also the difficulty of\\nknowledge acquisition\\n, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\\n[\\nc\\n]\\nPlanning and decision-making\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A\\nrational agent\\nhas goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.\\n[\\nd\\n]\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nIn\\nautomated planning\\n, the agent has a specific goal.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIn\\nautomated decision-making\\n, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"\\nutility\\n\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"\\nexpected utility\\n\": the\\nutility\\nof all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nIn\\nclassical planning\\n, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nIn most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with\\ninverse reinforcement learning\\n), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nInformation value theory\\ncan be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nThe space of possible future actions and situations is typically\\nintractably\\nlarge, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA\\nMarkov decision process\\nhas a\\ntransition model\\nthat describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a\\nreward function\\nthat supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A\\npolicy\\nassociates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by\\niteration\\n), be\\nheuristic\\n, or it can be learned.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nGame theory\\ndescribes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nLearning\\nMachine learning\\nis the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nIt has been a part of AI from the beginning.\\n[\\ne\\n]\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning.\\nUnsupervised learning\\nanalyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nSupervised learning\\nrequires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties:\\nclassification\\n(where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and\\nregression\\n(where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nIn\\nreinforcement learning\\n, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nTransfer learning\\nis when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nDeep learning\\nis a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired\\nartificial neural networks\\nfor all of these types of learning.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nComputational learning theory\\ncan assess learners by\\ncomputational complexity\\n, by\\nsample complexity\\n(how much data is required), or by other notions of\\noptimization\\n.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nNatural language processing\\nNatural language processing\\n(NLP)\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nallows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as\\nEnglish\\n. Specific problems include\\nspeech recognition\\n,\\nspeech synthesis\\n,\\nmachine translation\\n,\\ninformation extraction\\n,\\ninformation retrieval\\nand\\nquestion answering\\n.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nEarly work, based on\\nNoam Chomsky\\n\\'s\\ngenerative grammar\\nand\\nsemantic networks\\n, had difficulty with\\nword-sense disambiguation\\n[\\nf\\n]\\nunless restricted to small domains called \"\\nmicro-worlds\\n\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n).\\nMargaret Masterman\\nbelieved that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that\\nthesauri\\nand not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include\\nword embedding\\n(representing words, typically as\\nvectors\\nencoding their meaning),\\n[\\n52\\n]\\ntransformers\\n(a deep learning architecture using an\\nattention\\nmechanism),\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand others.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nIn 2019,\\ngenerative pre-trained transformer\\n(or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,\\n[\\n55\\n]\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nand by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the\\nbar exam\\n,\\nSAT\\ntest,\\nGRE\\ntest, and many other real-world applications.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nPerception\\nMachine perception\\nis the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active\\nlidar\\n, sonar, radar, and\\ntactile sensors\\n) to deduce aspects of the world.\\nComputer vision\\nis the ability to analyze visual input.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nThe field includes\\nspeech recognition\\n,\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nimage classification\\n,\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nfacial recognition\\n,\\nobject recognition\\n,\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nobject tracking\\n,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nand\\nrobotic perception\\n.\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nSocial intelligence\\nKismet\\n, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nAffective computing\\nis a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human\\nfeeling, emotion, and mood\\n.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nFor example, some\\nvirtual assistants\\nare programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate\\nhuman–computer interaction\\n.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nModerate successes related to affective computing include textual\\nsentiment analysis\\nand, more recently,\\nmultimodal sentiment analysis\\n, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nGeneral intelligence\\nA machine with\\nartificial general intelligence\\nshould be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to\\nhuman intelligence\\n.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nTechniques\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\\n[\\nb\\n]\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThere are two very different kinds of search used in AI:\\nstate space search\\nand\\nlocal search\\n.\\nState space search\\nState space search\\nsearches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nFor example,\\nplanning\\nalgorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called\\nmeans-ends analysis\\n.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nSimple exhaustive searches\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nare rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the\\nsearch space\\n(the number of places to search) quickly grows to\\nastronomical numbers\\n. The result is a search that is\\ntoo slow\\nor never completes.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n\"\\nHeuristics\\n\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nAdversarial search\\nis used for\\ngame-playing\\nprograms, such as chess or Go. It searches through a\\ntree\\nof possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nLocal search\\nIllustration of\\ngradient descent\\nfor 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the\\nloss function\\n(the height)\\nLocal search\\nuses\\nmathematical optimization\\nto find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nGradient descent\\nis a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a\\nloss function\\n.

AI agents are used in various applications, including\\nvirtual assistants\\n,\\nchatbots\\n,\\nautonomous vehicles\\n,\\ngame-playing systems\\n, and\\nindustrial robotics\\n. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.\\n[\\n185\\n]\\n[\\n186\\n]\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nSexuality\\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nAI-integrated sex toys (e.g.,\\nteledildonics\\n),\\n[\\n189\\n]\\nAI-generated sexual education content,\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nand AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g.,\\nReplika\\n).\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nAI is also used for the production of non-consensual\\ndeepfake pornography\\n, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify\\nonline gender-based violence\\nand online\\nsexual grooming\\nof minors.\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nOther industry-specific tasks\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions.

AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.\\n[\\n222\\n]\\nA 2024\\nGoldman Sachs\\nResearch Paper,\\nAI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge\\n, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.\\n[\\n223\\n]\\nData centers\\' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.\\n[\\n224\\n]\\nIn 2024, the\\nWall Street Journal\\nreported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers.

Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US\\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\\n. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US\\nInflation Reduction Act\\n.\\n[\\n227\\n]\\nThe US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the\\nPalisades Nuclear\\nreactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of\\nExelon\\nwho was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.\\n[\\n228\\n]\\nAfter the last approval in September 2023,\\nTaiwan\\nsuspended the approval of data centers north of\\nTaoyuan\\nwith a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.\\n[\\n229\\n]\\nTaiwan aims to\\nphase out nuclear power\\nby 2025.\\n[\\n229\\n]\\nOn the other hand,\\nSingapore\\nimposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.\\n[\\n229\\n]\\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011\\nFukushima nuclear accident\\n, according to an October 2024\\nBloomberg\\narticle in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.\\n[\\n230\\n]\\nUbitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.\\n[\\n230\\n]\\nOn 1 November 2024, the\\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission\\n(FERC) rejected an application submitted by\\nTalen Energy\\nfor approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station\\nSusquehanna\\nto Amazon\\'s data center.\\n[\\n231\\n]\\nAccording to the Commission Chairman\\nWillie L.

By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300-500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but\\nrebound effects\\n(for example if people will pass from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.\\n[\\n232\\n]\\nMisinformation\\nSee also:\\nYouTube §\\xa0Moderation and offensive content\\nYouTube\\n,\\nFacebook\\nand others use\\nrecommender systems\\nto guide users to more content.

The AI learned that users tended to choose\\nmisinformation\\n,\\nconspiracy theories\\n, and extreme\\npartisan\\ncontent, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into\\nfilter bubbles\\nwhere they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.\\n[\\n233\\n]\\nThis convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.\\n[\\n234\\n]\\nThe AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.\\n[\\n235\\n]\\nIn 2022,\\ngenerative AI\\nbegan to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing.

The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,\\n[\\n245\\n]\\na problem called \"sample size disparity\".\\n[\\n246\\n]\\nGoogle \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling\\nanything\\nas a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.\\n[\\n247\\n]\\nCOMPAS\\nis a commercial program widely used by\\nU.S. courts\\nto assess the likelihood of a\\ndefendant\\nbecoming a\\nrecidivist\\n. In 2016,\\nJulia Angwin\\nat\\nProPublica\\ndiscovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.\\n[\\n248\\n]\\nIn 2017, several researchers\\n[\\nl\\n]\\nshowed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.\\n[\\n250\\n]\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".\\n[\\n251\\n]\\nMoritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"\\n[\\n252\\n]\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as\\nrecommendations\\n, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.\\n[\\n253\\n]\\nThus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be\\nbetter\\nthan the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.\\n[\\nm\\n]\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.\\n[\\n246\\n]\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is\\ndistributive fairness\\n, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative\\nstereotypes\\nor render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with\\nanti-discrimination laws\\n.\\n[\\n240\\n]\\nAt its 2022\\nConference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\\n(ACM FAccT 2022), the\\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\\n, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\\n[\\ndubious\\n–\\ndiscuss\\n]\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nLack of transparency\\nSee also:\\nExplainable AI\\n,\\nAlgorithmic transparency\\n, and\\nRight to explanation\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.\\n[\\n256\\n]\\nParticularly with\\ndeep neural networks\\n, in which there are a large amount of non-\\nlinear\\nrelationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.\\n[\\n257\\n]\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a\\nruler\\nas \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.\\n[\\n258\\n]\\nAnother machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\\n[\\n259\\n]\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.\\n[\\n260\\n]\\nDoctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\\nin 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.\\n[\\nn\\n]\\nIndustry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.\\n[\\n261\\n]\\nDARPA\\nestablished the\\nXAI\\n(\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.\\n[\\n262\\n]\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem.

It is a\\nfield of research\\nin\\ncomputer science\\nthat develops and studies methods and\\nsoftware\\nthat enable machines to\\nperceive their environment\\nand use\\nlearning\\nand\\nintelligence\\nto take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nHigh-profile\\napplications of AI\\ninclude advanced\\nweb search engines\\n(e.g.,\\nGoogle Search\\n);\\nrecommendation systems\\n(used by\\nYouTube\\n,\\nAmazon\\n, and\\nNetflix\\n);\\nvirtual assistants\\n(e.g.,\\nGoogle Assistant\\n,\\nSiri\\n, and\\nAlexa\\n);\\nautonomous vehicles\\n(e.g.,\\nWaymo\\n);\\ngenerative\\nand\\ncreative\\ntools (e.g.,\\nChatGPT\\nand\\nAI art\\n); and\\nsuperhuman\\nplay and analysis in\\nstrategy games\\n(e.g.,\\nchess\\nand\\nGo\\n). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s\\nnot labeled AI anymore\\n.\"\\n[\\n2\\n]\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning,\\nreasoning\\n,\\nknowledge representation\\n,\\nplanning\\n,\\nnatural language processing\\n,\\nperception\\n, and support for\\nrobotics\\n.\\n[\\na\\n]\\nTo reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including\\nsearch\\nand\\nmathematical optimization\\n,\\nformal logic\\n,\\nartificial neural networks\\n, and methods based on\\nstatistics\\n,\\noperations research\\n, and\\neconomics\\n.\\n[\\nb\\n]\\nAI also draws upon\\npsychology\\n,\\nlinguistics\\n,\\nphilosophy\\n,\\nneuroscience\\n, and other fields.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nSome companies, such as\\nOpenAI\\n,\\nGoogle DeepMind\\nand\\nMeta\\n, aim to create\\nartificial general intelligence\\n(AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nand the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout\\nits history\\n,\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nfollowed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as\\nAI winters\\n.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nFunding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when\\ngraphics processing units\\nstarted being used to accelerate neural networks, and\\ndeep learning\\noutperformed previous AI techniques.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nThis growth accelerated further after 2017 with the\\ntransformer architecture\\n.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nIn the 2020s, the period of rapid\\nprogress\\nmarked by advanced generative AI became known as the\\nAI boom\\n. Generative AI and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised\\nethical concerns\\nabout\\nAI\\'s long-term effects\\nand potential\\nexistential risks\\n, prompting discussions about\\nregulatory policies\\nto ensure the\\nsafety\\nand benefits of the technology.\\nGoals\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n[\\na\\n]\\nReasoning and problem-solving\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical\\ndeductions\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nBy the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with\\nuncertain\\nor incomplete information, employing concepts from\\nprobability\\nand\\neconomics\\n.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nEven humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAccurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\nKnowledge representation\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\nKnowledge representation\\nand\\nknowledge engineering\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nallow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nscene interpretation,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nclinical decision support,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nknowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large\\ndatabases\\n),\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nand other areas.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nA\\nknowledge base\\nis a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An\\nontology\\nis the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nKnowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nsituations, events, states, and time;\\n[\\n25\\n]\\ncauses and effects;\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nknowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);\\n[\\n27\\n]\\ndefault reasoning\\n(things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nand many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of\\ncommonsense knowledge\\n(the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nand the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nThere is also the difficulty of\\nknowledge acquisition\\n, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\\n[\\nc\\n]\\nPlanning and decision-making\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A\\nrational agent\\nhas goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.\\n[\\nd\\n]\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nIn\\nautomated planning\\n, the agent has a specific goal.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIn\\nautomated decision-making\\n, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"\\nutility\\n\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"\\nexpected utility\\n\": the\\nutility\\nof all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nIn\\nclassical planning\\n, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nIn most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with\\ninverse reinforcement learning\\n), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nInformation value theory\\ncan be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nThe space of possible future actions and situations is typically\\nintractably\\nlarge, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA\\nMarkov decision process\\nhas a\\ntransition model\\nthat describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a\\nreward function\\nthat supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A\\npolicy\\nassociates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by\\niteration\\n), be\\nheuristic\\n, or it can be learned.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nGame theory\\ndescribes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nLearning\\nMachine learning\\nis the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nIt has been a part of AI from the beginning.\\n[\\ne\\n]\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning.\\nUnsupervised learning\\nanalyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nSupervised learning\\nrequires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties:\\nclassification\\n(where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and\\nregression\\n(where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nIn\\nreinforcement learning\\n, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nTransfer learning\\nis when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nDeep learning\\nis a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired\\nartificial neural networks\\nfor all of these types of learning.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nComputational learning theory\\ncan assess learners by\\ncomputational complexity\\n, by\\nsample complexity\\n(how much data is required), or by other notions of\\noptimization\\n.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nNatural language processing\\nNatural language processing\\n(NLP)\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nallows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as\\nEnglish\\n. Specific problems include\\nspeech recognition\\n,\\nspeech synthesis\\n,\\nmachine translation\\n,\\ninformation extraction\\n,\\ninformation retrieval\\nand\\nquestion answering\\n.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nEarly work, based on\\nNoam Chomsky\\n\\'s\\ngenerative grammar\\nand\\nsemantic networks\\n, had difficulty with\\nword-sense disambiguation\\n[\\nf\\n]\\nunless restricted to small domains called \"\\nmicro-worlds\\n\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n).\\nMargaret Masterman\\nbelieved that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that\\nthesauri\\nand not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include\\nword embedding\\n(representing words, typically as\\nvectors\\nencoding their meaning),\\n[\\n52\\n]\\ntransformers\\n(a deep learning architecture using an\\nattention\\nmechanism),\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand others.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nIn 2019,\\ngenerative pre-trained transformer\\n(or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,\\n[\\n55\\n]\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nand by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the\\nbar exam\\n,\\nSAT\\ntest,\\nGRE\\ntest, and many other real-world applications.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nPerception\\nMachine perception\\nis the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active\\nlidar\\n, sonar, radar, and\\ntactile sensors\\n) to deduce aspects of the world.\\nComputer vision\\nis the ability to analyze visual input.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nThe field includes\\nspeech recognition\\n,\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nimage classification\\n,\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nfacial recognition\\n,\\nobject recognition\\n,\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nobject tracking\\n,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nand\\nrobotic perception\\n.\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nSocial intelligence\\nKismet\\n, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nAffective computing\\nis a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human\\nfeeling, emotion, and mood\\n.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nFor example, some\\nvirtual assistants\\nare programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate\\nhuman–computer interaction\\n.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nModerate successes related to affective computing include textual\\nsentiment analysis\\nand, more recently,\\nmultimodal sentiment analysis\\n, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nGeneral intelligence\\nA machine with\\nartificial general intelligence\\nshould be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to\\nhuman intelligence\\n.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nTechniques\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\\n[\\nb\\n]\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThere are two very different kinds of search used in AI:\\nstate space search\\nand\\nlocal search\\n.\\nState space search\\nState space search\\nsearches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nFor example,\\nplanning\\nalgorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called\\nmeans-ends analysis\\n.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nSimple exhaustive searches\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nare rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the\\nsearch space\\n(the number of places to search) quickly grows to\\nastronomical numbers\\n. The result is a search that is\\ntoo slow\\nor never completes.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n\"\\nHeuristics\\n\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nAdversarial search\\nis used for\\ngame-playing\\nprograms, such as chess or Go. It searches through a\\ntree\\nof possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nLocal search\\nIllustration of\\ngradient descent\\nfor 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the\\nloss function\\n(the height)\\nLocal search\\nuses\\nmathematical optimization\\nto find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nGradient descent\\nis a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a\\nloss function\\n. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train\\nneural networks\\n,\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nthrough the\\nbackpropagation\\nalgorithm.\\nAnother type of local search is\\nevolutionary computation\\n, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them,\\nselecting\\nonly the fittest to survive each generation.\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via\\nswarm intelligence\\nalgorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are\\nparticle swarm optimization\\n(inspired by bird\\nflocking\\n) and\\nant colony optimization\\n(inspired by\\nant trails\\n).\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nLogic\\nFormal\\nlogic\\nis used for\\nreasoning\\nand\\nknowledge representation\\n.\\n[\\n79\\n]\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms:\\npropositional logic\\n(which operates on statements that are true or false and uses\\nlogical connectives\\nsuch as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nand\\npredicate logic\\n(which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses\\nquantifiers\\nsuch as \"\\nEvery\\nX\\nis a\\nY\\n\" and \"There are\\nsome\\nX\\ns that are\\nY\\ns\").\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nDeductive reasoning\\nin logic is the process of\\nproving\\na new statement (\\nconclusion\\n) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the\\npremises\\n).\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nProofs can be structured as proof\\ntrees\\n, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by\\ninference rules\\n.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose\\nleaf nodes\\nare labelled by premises or\\naxioms\\n. In the case of\\nHorn clauses\\n, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning\\nforwards\\nfrom the premises or\\nbackwards\\nfrom the problem.\\n[\\n83\\n]\\nIn the more general case of the clausal form of\\nfirst-order logic\\n,\\nresolution\\nis a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\\n[\\n84\\n]\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is\\nundecidable\\n, and therefore\\nintractable\\n. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the\\nlogic programming\\nlanguage\\nProlog\\n, is\\nTuring complete\\n. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other\\nsymbolic programming\\nlanguages.\\n[\\n85\\n]\\nFuzzy logic\\nassigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.\\n[\\n86\\n]\\nNon-monotonic logics\\n, including logic programming with\\nnegation as failure\\n, are designed to handle\\ndefault reasoning\\n.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nOther specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\nA simple\\nBayesian network\\n, with the associated\\nconditional probability tables\\nMany problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from\\nprobability\\ntheory and economics.\\n[\\n87\\n]\\nPrecise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using\\ndecision theory\\n,\\ndecision analysis\\n,\\n[\\n88\\n]\\nand\\ninformation value theory\\n.\\n[\\n89\\n]\\nThese tools include models such as\\nMarkov decision processes\\n,\\n[\\n90\\n]\\ndynamic\\ndecision networks\\n,\\n[\\n91\\n]\\ngame theory\\nand\\nmechanism design\\n.\\n[\\n92\\n]\\nBayesian networks\\n[\\n93\\n]\\nare a tool that can be used for\\nreasoning\\n(using the\\nBayesian inference\\nalgorithm),\\n[\\ng\\n]\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nlearning\\n(using the\\nexpectation–maximization algorithm\\n),\\n[\\nh\\n]\\n[\\n97\\n]\\nplanning\\n(using\\ndecision networks\\n)\\n[\\n98\\n]\\nand\\nperception\\n(using\\ndynamic Bayesian networks\\n).\\n[\\n91\\n]\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g.,\\nhidden Markov models\\nor\\nKalman filters\\n).\\n[\\n91\\n]\\nExpectation–maximization\\nclustering\\nof\\nOld Faithful\\neruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.\\nClassifiers\\n[\\n99\\n]\\nare functions that use\\npattern matching\\nto determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using\\nsupervised learning\\n. Each pattern (also called an \"\\nobservation\\n\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a\\ndata set\\n. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nThe\\ndecision tree\\nis the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nK-nearest neighbor\\nalgorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and\\nKernel methods\\nsuch as the\\nsupport vector machine\\n(SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nThe\\nnaive Bayes classifier\\nis reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nat Google, due in part to its scalability.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nNeural networks\\nare also used as classifiers.\\n[\\n105\\n]\\nArtificial neural networks\\nA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of\\nneurons\\nin the\\nhuman brain\\n.\\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as\\nartificial neurons\\n, which loosely model the\\nneurons\\nin a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the\\nweight\\ncrosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.\\n[\\n105\\n]\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use\\nlocal search\\nto choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the\\nbackpropagation\\nalgorithm.\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nNeural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and\\nfind patterns\\nin data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\nIn\\nfeedforward neural networks\\nthe signal passes in only one direction.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nRecurrent neural networks\\nfeed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events.\\nLong short term memory\\nis the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nPerceptrons\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nuse only a single layer of neurons; deep learning\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nuses multiple layers.\\nConvolutional neural networks\\nstrengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in\\nimage processing\\n, where a local set of neurons must\\nidentify an \"edge\"\\nbefore the network can identify an object.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nDeep learning\\nDeep learning\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nuses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in\\nimage processing\\n, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including\\ncomputer vision\\n,\\nspeech recognition\\n,\\nnatural language processing\\n,\\nimage classification\\n,\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nand others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nThe sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)\\n[\\ni\\n]\\nbut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to\\nGPUs\\n) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant\\ncurated datasets\\nused for benchmark testing, such as\\nImageNet\\n.\\n[\\nj\\n]\\nGPT\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers\\n(GPT) are\\nlarge language models\\n(LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large\\ncorpus of text\\nthat can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next\\ntoken\\n(a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called\\nreinforcement learning from human feedback\\n(RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"\\nhallucinations\\n\".

These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including\\nvirtual assistants\\n,\\nchatbots\\n,\\nautonomous vehicles\\n,\\ngame-playing systems\\n, and\\nindustrial robotics\\n. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.\\n[\\n185\\n]\\n[\\n186\\n]\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nSexuality\\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nAI-integrated sex toys (e.g.,\\nteledildonics\\n),\\n[\\n189\\n]\\nAI-generated sexual education content,\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nand AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g.,\\nReplika\\n).\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nAI is also used for the production of non-consensual\\ndeepfake pornography\\n, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify\\nonline gender-based violence\\nand online\\nsexual grooming\\nof minors.\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nOther industry-specific tasks\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions.

There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now.

If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced.

One broad category is\\ndistributive fairness\\n, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative\\nstereotypes\\nor render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with\\nanti-discrimination laws\\n.\\n[\\n240\\n]\\nAt its 2022\\nConference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\\n(ACM FAccT 2022), the\\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\\n, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\\n[\\ndubious\\n–\\ndiscuss\\n]\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nLack of transparency\\nSee also:\\nExplainable AI\\n,\\nAlgorithmic transparency\\n, and\\nRight to explanation\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.\\n[\\n256\\n]\\nParticularly with\\ndeep neural networks\\n, in which there are a large amount of non-\\nlinear\\nrelationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.\\n[\\n257\\n]\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a\\nruler\\nas \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.\\n[\\n258\\n]\\nAnother machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\\n[\\n259\\n]\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.\\n[\\n260\\n]\\nDoctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\\nin 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.\\n[\\nn\\n]\\nIndustry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.\\n[\\n261\\n]\\nDARPA\\nestablished the\\nXAI\\n(\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.\\n[\\n262\\n]\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem.

Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher\\nNick Bostrom\\nargued that if one gives\\nalmost any\\ngoal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a\\npaperclip factory manager\\n).\\n[\\n288\\n]\\nStuart Russell\\ngives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\"\\n[\\n289\\n]\\nIn order to be safe for humanity, a\\nsuperintelligence\\nwould have to be genuinely\\naligned\\nwith humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".\\n[\\n290\\n]\\nSecond,\\nYuval Noah Harari\\nargues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk.

AI pioneer\\nJürgen Schmidhuber\\ndid not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"\\n[\\n298\\n]\\nWhile the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"\\n[\\n299\\n]\\n[\\n300\\n]\\nAndrew Ng\\nalso argued that \"it\\'s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"\\n[\\n301\\n]\\nYann LeCun\\n\"scoffs at his peers\\' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"\\n[\\n302\\n]\\nIn the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.\\n[\\n303\\n]\\nHowever, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.\\n[\\n304\\n]\\nEthical machines and alignment\\nMain articles:\\nMachine ethics\\n,\\nAI safety\\n,\\nFriendly artificial intelligence\\n,\\nArtificial moral agents\\n, and\\nHuman Compatible\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans.\\nEliezer Yudkowsky\\n, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.\\n[\\n305\\n]\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.\\n[\\n306\\n]\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,\\n[\\n306\\n]\\nand was founded at an\\nAAAI\\nsymposium in 2005.\\n[\\n307\\n]\\nOther approaches include\\nWendell Wallach\\n\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"\\n[\\n308\\n]\\nand\\nStuart J.

Open-weight models can be freely\\nfine-tuned\\n, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.\\n[\\n315\\n]\\nOpen-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate\\nbioterrorism\\n) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.\\n[\\n316\\n]\\nFrameworks\\nArtificial Intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system.

They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the\\nphysical symbol systems hypothesis\\n: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\\n[\\n393\\n]\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or\\ncommonsense reasoning\\n.\\nMoravec\\'s paradox\\nis the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.\\n[\\n394\\n]\\nPhilosopher\\nHubert Dreyfus\\nhad\\nargued\\nsince the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.\\n[\\n395\\n]\\nAlthough his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.\\n[\\nab\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nThe issue is not resolved:\\nsub-symbolic\\nreasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as\\nalgorithmic bias\\n.

Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work.

It is also typically the central question at issue in\\nartificial intelligence in fiction\\n.\\nConsciousness\\nMain articles:\\nHard problem of consciousness\\nand\\nTheory of mind\\nDavid Chalmers\\nidentified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.\\n[\\n403\\n]\\nThe easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this\\nfeels\\nor why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human\\ninformation processing\\nis easy to explain, human\\nsubjective experience\\nis difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to\\nknow what red looks like\\n.\\n[\\n404\\n]\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\nMain articles:\\nComputational theory of mind\\nand\\nFunctionalism (philosophy of mind)\\nComputationalism is the position in the\\nphilosophy of mind\\nthat the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the\\nmind–body problem\\n. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers\\nJerry Fodor\\nand\\nHilary Putnam\\n.\\n[\\n405\\n]\\nPhilosopher\\nJohn Searle\\ncharacterized this position as \"\\nstrong AI\\n\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"\\n[\\nac\\n]\\nSearle challenges this claim with his\\nChinese room\\nargument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.\\n[\\n409\\n]\\nAI welfare and rights\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced\\nAI is sentient\\n(has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.\\n[\\n410\\n]\\nBut if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.\\n[\\n411\\n]\\n[\\n412\\n]\\nSapience\\n(a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or\\nself-awareness\\n) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.\\n[\\n411\\n]\\nRobot rights\\nare also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.\\n[\\n413\\n]\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.\\n[\\n414\\n]\\nCritics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of\\nhuman rights\\n, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.\\n[\\n415\\n]\\n[\\n416\\n]\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny.
