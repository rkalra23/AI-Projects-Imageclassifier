    "The python class OpenAI is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.\n",

    "When you call openai.chat.completions.create(), this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",

    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions\n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to understand the basics about LLMs—Large Language Models. The user asked for definitions of neural networks, attention, and transformers. Hmm, let's break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, what are LLMs? They're these models that can comprehend and generate human-level text. So they have some advanced technology behind them, right? But I need to remember the core parts: neural networks, attention, and transformers. Let me tackle each one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with neural networks since that's the backbone. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain. They have these connections between neurons that process information. From what I know, LLMs use a type of neural network called a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN). Wait, RNNs can remember previous data, which is important for language. Also, they often include attention mechanisms and some kind of layer from the future because LLMs can look ahead when generating text. Oh right, that allows them to generate text in chunks, handling various structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is attention. I know it's about focusing on specific parts of the input or hidden states. The model reads a sentence and chooses important words based on their context. This helps it understand where to focus when translating or answering questions. It makes the models more adaptable since they can handle multiple languages without retraining everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the transformer, which I remember is different from RNNs. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms within each attention head. They don't process sequences one at a time but do so simultaneously for all positions. This parallel processing makes them faster and efficient. Plus, transformers are used in models that scale to huge datasets without issues because of their distributed nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together: the LLMs use these components—neural networks with attention and transformers—to make accurate, fluent, context-aware responses. They're like machines able to understand any language through processing words and context efficiently.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to generate human-level text across a wide range of domains, including translation, answering questions, creative writing, and content creation for various industries. The ability of LLMs to comprehend and respond to complex queries stems from their internal processing mechanisms, drawing upon sophisticated computational techniques such as neural networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Concepts Behind LLMs: A Deep dive into Neural Networks, Attention, and Transformers\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Neural Networks**\n",
      "\n",
      "The foundation of any LLM is at least a simplified form of a neural network. The original architecture, developed by the renowned machine learning researcher Ian Goodfellow, draws inspiration from biological neural networks observed in the brain. For LLMs, the most common type of neural network used is designed to process sequential data—this includes both forward and backward data flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Components of the Neural Network:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- ** bidirectional Recurrence Layer:** Unlike traditional RNNs that only look at past inputs (forward direction), bidirectional recurrent layers can also consider future inputs. This dual processing helps enhance the model's ability to understand context across different sentences and languages.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Attention Mechanism:** A key feature of some LLMs is the attention mechanism, used in architectures like BERT or others. This component allows models to focus on specific parts of input data (words) based on their contextual relevance during processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Attention Mechanisms**\n",
      "\n",
      "The attention mechanism enables models to pay attention to different important parts within each sequence when making decisions or generating outputs. This means that the model can highlight key words, phrases, or sentences rather than every word in the entire text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Attention Works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- LLMs examine input data and compute similarity scores (often referred to as \"causal attention\") for pairs of tokens.\n",
      "- Tokens are weighted according to these similarity scores during both forward and backward passes through the network.\n",
      "- The top-k highest similarities dictate where to focus when processing sentences or generating responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Transformers**\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers are a type of neural network structure that introduced significant innovation in the field of NLP. They differ from traditional RNNs by processing sequences simultaneously rather than sequentially, which has led to better efficiency and results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Features of Transformers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Self-Attention:** Each token is processed using self-attention on all other tokens within a sequence simultaneously. This parallel processing across all input vectors is key to their efficiency.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - The model attends to pairs of positions (tokens) in the sentence to compute attention scores, which are then passed through for generating outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Multi-Headed Attention:** Transformers use multiple independent heads (multi-processors) that each handle a different subset of the data for better context sensitivity and higher accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Applications of Transformers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers are used throughout the LLM architecture. The foundation typically includes a Transformer block, followed or preceded by feedforward layers. These components together create models capable of processing information in parallel while maintaining the fine-grained structure needed for accurate understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs leverage neural networks with attention and transformers to enhance their ability to process language accurately, adaptively explore multiple languages, and generate contextually coherent responses across domains. Understanding these core concepts provides insight into how advanced AI systems like LLMs continue to shape human communication and creativity.\n"
